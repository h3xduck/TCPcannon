# TCPcannon

TCPcannon is a Linux tool for launching network attacks. It is built on top of [RawTCP](https://github.com/marsan27/RawTCP_Lib.git), my library to manage network packets and raw sockets. 

The purpose of this development is to reproduce real network attacks using only the C language and with minimal dependencies.

The name is a reference to the [LOIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon).
